## Roadmap

- Assess whether there is any inconsistency in temporal resolution and/or values between the data from Abrolhos and Fernando de Noronha buoy from the PNBOIA website (links at column operational_path of the file [ocean_fixed_station](ocean_fixed_stations.csv)) and REMObs websites (respectivly, http://boia-abrolhos.herokuapp.com/ and http://noronha.herokuapp.com/)
- Insert tide gauge data
  - In the ocean-fixed-stations.csv file or in a new one?
